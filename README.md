# Whisky Drops - Bootstrap version 4

#### The index.html 
In the file index.html i have the complete code and it is named index.html so that GitHub knows what file to reference to when putting up a webpage.
The index.html file uses the bootstrap version 3.3.7 and the verisons from 01-08 uses the bootstrap version 4.1.3

In these files I have saved the version of codes from the start of the video series

## 1. Mobile first
When starting a project make sure that you start from the mobile version first and then work your way up to higher resolution.
Make sure to include the Viewport link:
 
<  meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">""

This is used for the mobile first approach and lets me use the devtools in the browser.

## 2. Core CSS
Bootstrap includes a core library of CSS style and helpers that you can use to make smaller changes and tweaks to your page.

## 3. The Grid
A grid is a system used in web and graphic design to help you define the structure and layout of your content consistently by breaking your pages up into set of rows and columns.
